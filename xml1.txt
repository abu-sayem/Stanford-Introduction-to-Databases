Q2:In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. There are multiple departments, each with a department chair, some courses, and professors and/or lecturers who teach courses.

<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department)*>
<!ELEMENT Department (Title, Chair, Course*)>
<!ATTLIST Department Code CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST Course Number CDATA #REQUIRED Enrollment CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT Chair (Professor)>
<!ELEMENT Professor (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ELEMENT First_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Middle_Initial (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Last_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Course (Title, Description?, Instructors, Prerequisites?)>
<!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Description (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Instructors (Lecturer|Professor)*>
<!ELEMENT Lecturer (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ELEMENT Prerequisites (Prereq)*>
<!ELEMENT Prereq (#PCDATA)>

Q3: In this question, you are to create a DTD for a different version of the data set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. This version encodes the data using ID and IDREF(S) attributes.

<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department)*>
<!ATTLIST Department Code ID #REQUIRED Chair IDREF #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT Department (Title, Course*, (Professor |  Lecturer)*)>
<!ATTLIST Professor InstrID ID #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST Lecturer InstrID ID #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT Course (Title, Description?)>
<!ATTLIST Course Number ID #REQUIRED Prerequisites CDATA #IMPLIED Instructors CDATA #REQUIRED Enrollment CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Description (#PCDATA|Courseref)*>
<!ELEMENT Courseref (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST Courseref Number IDREF #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT Professor (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ELEMENT Lecturer (First_Name, Middle_Initial?, Last_Name)>
<!ELEMENT First_Name (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Middle_Initial (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Last_Name (#PCDATA)>
